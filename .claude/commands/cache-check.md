description: Inspect KV cache performance and contents
---

Analyze KV cache usage and performance:

**Cache Metrics:**
- Hit/miss ratios across endpoints
- Most frequently cached items
- TTL expiration patterns

**Cache Inspection:**
- List cache keys by prefix (book:, cover:, etc.)
- Check specific cache entries
- Verify cache metadata and expiration

**Optimization Opportunities:**
- Identify cache churn (frequent writes)
- Suggest TTL adjustments
- Find uncached expensive operations
