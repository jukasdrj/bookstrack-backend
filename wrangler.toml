#
# Remote Bindings (Wrangler v4.37+)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# You can now access production resources during local development by setting
# `remote = true` on individual bindings (KV, R2, D1, etc.).
#
# Benefits:
#   - Test local code changes against real production data
#   - Share resources across development team
#   - Reproduce bugs tied to real data
#   - No need to deploy for every test iteration
#
# Usage:
#   1. Uncomment `remote = true` on any binding below
#   2. Run `npx wrangler dev` as normal
#   3. Your local code will connect to production resources
#
# Example:
#   [[kv_namespaces]]
#   binding = "CACHE"
#   id = "b9cade63b6db48fd80c109a013f38fdb"
#   remote = true  # ✅ Access production KV cache from local dev
#

# Limit: 10 requests per 60-second window per IP (protects expensive AI/enrichment endpoints)
# Cost: ~$0 (DO requests included in Workers plan with ~100 calls/min peak)

# CORS Configuration
# Current: 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *' (permissive)
# Reason: Primary client is native iOS app (doesn't send Origin header)
# Defense: Rate limiting (10 req/min) prevents abuse
# Phase 2: Restrict CORS when web interface is added (see src/middleware/cors.js)
